# Ruby on Rails Queijos App

This is an app to help my mom with her newly cheese business.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```ruby
$ gem install bundler -v 2.3.14
$ bundle _2.3.14_ config set --local without 'production'
$ bundle _2.3.14_ install
```

```ruby
$ rails db:setup
$ rails server
```
It's a WIP but go checkout the [home page](http://localhost:3000/), and the [products page](http://localhost:3000/products), you can also edit or add some [new products](http://localhost:3000/products/new) for fun.
